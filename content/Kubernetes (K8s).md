Is a FOSS container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, management, and scaling of containers at scale using [[Declarative Configuration]]. As opposed to [[Docker]] - which is used to build, ship, and run individual containers on a specific machine - K8s is used to manage many containers across multiple machines in a production environment.

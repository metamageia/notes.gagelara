- Some interesting conversations with Sigilla this morning accompanied by some tweaks to vault structure and affordances. 
- Morning priority is some light prep before our next Trespasser session later today. 
	- Elis made a really cool sketch of the surviving commoners-turned-player-characters from our first session
	- Got all essential printed materials prepared, waiting for some confirmations before printing supplementary materials 
- Had a good session today, mostly just leveling up characters and teaching the travel and haven frame. Now they're getting into the sandbox play proper, going to be interesting to see what they do 
- Started working on some trespasser dungeon design protocols that'll hopefully help me further speed up session prep

- Been doing some brainstorming on how to more efficiently run the trespasser sandbox with minimal prep. The biggest bottlenecks are encounter and dungeon design, especially when I don't know where the players will go and what they'll do. 
	- I need to prep some more POI/Hex detail tables, and extend the calendar. Maybe get the rough shape of the regions to the north, south, and west. 
- Slowly updating my GM binder to include more resources for low prep sandbox play, going to research more tools that should hopefully help

- OCI IAM
	- AuthZ - Who are you?
	- AuthN - What can you do?
	- Identity Domains
		- Containers for users & groups with Policies
	- Policies define Permissions
		- Can be attached to compartments or tenancies
		- Human-readable code with domains, verbs, resources, locations, conditions, etc.
	- Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) Assigned to resources 
	- Tenancy: Account
		- Tenancy Admin: Whole Account
		- OCI Admin: Manage specific group(s)
	- Principals
		- IAM Identities allowed to interact with OCI resources: IAM Users or Resource Principals
- Compartments
	- Used to group, isolate, and permission resources. 
	- Resources can interact with those in other compartments, and be transferred them. 
	- Region-Agnostic, Six levels of nesting, Quotas & Budgets 
- Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
	- [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]] 
	- Address space with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)|CIDR]] addressed [[Subnet]]s
	- Internet Gateway for accessing public internet
	- NAT Gateway to provide NAT as a service for one direction outbound communication
	- Service Gateway for resources to access OCI Resources/Services securely 
	- Dynamic Routing Gateway for securely connecting VCN and On-Prem environment. 
	- Route Table: Set of rules for connecting CIDR Block and Rout Target 
		- Longest Prefix Match: Most Specific destination takes priority 
		- Network Peering
			- Local Peering Gateway in the same Region
			- Remote Peering with Dynamic Routing Gateway between regions 
				- DRG v2 Can connect up to 300 VCNs. 
	- Security List
		- Firewall Rules applied to a Subnet: Either Stateful or Stateless 
	- Network Security Groups 
		- Only apply to a set of Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNIC) in a VCN
	- Load Balancer
		- Reverse Proxy 
		- Provides High Availability and scalability
		- Layer 7 [[OSI Model]] 
	- Network Load Balaner
		- OSI Layer 3/4 
- OCI Compute
	- Bare Metal and VMs for shared machines, Dedicated Host for fully personal
	- Flexible Shapes *OCPUs an Memory are flexible* as opposed to "T-Shirt Sizing"
	- Both AMD, Intel, and Ampere
	- Preemptible VMs
	- Instances
		- A compute Host with VNIC within a subnet
		- Boot Disk & Data in a block volume
		- Transparent Live Migration between hosts without rebooting
		- OCI Cloud Shell 
	- Scaling
		- Vertical - Change Instance Shape with downtime
		- Horizontal - Autoscaling 
			- Instance config
			- Instance Pool - Operate as one unit
				- Scaling Rules with limits 
	- OKE - OCI Managed Kubernetes
		- VMs Have Hypervisor, run with OS 
		- Containers only run library / dependencies 
		- [[Kubernetes (K8s)|Kubernetes]]
	- OCI Container Instances
		- Managed Docker / Container Service
	- Oracle Functions
		- Serverless Compute (like AWS Lambda) 
		- Consumption based pricing 
- Storage
	- Local NVMe - Locally attached VM Storage
	- Block Volume - Partitioned
		- Persistent and Durable storage to a compute instance
		- Tiers based on I/O: Lower, Balanced, High Performance, Ultra High - Auto Scaling available 
		- Read/Write Sharable - share volume between instances
		- Scale volume size
		- Volume Groups for time consistent backups across volume 
	- File Storage - Shared Across instances
		- Hierarchical Collections - NFS and SMB
		- Example Uses
			- Oracles Applications
			- Microservices and Containers
		- 
	- Object Storage - Objects accessed via web
		- Unstructured Data, Regional, Public or Private 
		- Object Name:Value w/ Metadata
		- Namesppace
		- Bucket: Flat Structure with Prefixes for simulated heirarchy
		- Tiers
			- Standard / Hot
			- Infrequent Acces / Cool - Cheaper, But limitations
			- Archival / Cold - Longterm
			- Auto-Tiering - Auto-pricing based on traffic 
			- Lifecycle management and versioning and encryption
			- Accessed by HTTP API

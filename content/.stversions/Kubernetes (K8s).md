Is a FOSS container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, management, and scaling of containers at scale using [[Declarative Configuration]]. As opposed to [[Docker]] - which is used to build, ship, and run individual containers on a specific machine - K8s is used to manage many containers across multiple machines in a production environment. 

In a directory with Kubernetes configuration files, the command `sudo kubectl apply -f <file>` can be used to apply the configuration

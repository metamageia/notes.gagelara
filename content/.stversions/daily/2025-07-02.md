- Completed [[The Cloud Resume Challenge (Notes)]]
	- Wrote and published a [blog post about my experience](https://blog.gagelara.com/post/the-cloud-resume-challenge/) 

Sharing a pretty big milestone, I've just completed the [AWS Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). It was my first major cloud project and it was pretty difficult, but also a lot of fun. The website is live at [gagelara.com](https://gagelara.com) and I wrote [a blog post](https://blog.gagelara.com/post/the-cloud-resume-challenge/) sharing a bit of my experience working on the project. 

The only omission from the challenge was getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, which while nice to have we are not in a financial position where I can afford to sit the exam anytime soon. The project by itself is a huge boon to my resume though, and I'm praying it helps me land some sort of job soon.

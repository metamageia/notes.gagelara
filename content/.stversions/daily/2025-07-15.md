Hey Theo! I loved your video about your search engine Unducked, after setting it up myself it quickly became my favorite way to search. However, I'd sometimes catch myself trying to use it in apps other than my browser, so I set up a script that turned Fuzzel (my go-to application launcher) into an Unducked search bar available anywhere on my computer. 

I wrote a *very* short post about it on my blog if you're interested:

Keep up the great videos, your channel's definitely among my favorites. 


P.S. The !t3 Bang has become my favorite way to use AI outside an editor. Wildly convenient now that I can use it from any app and immediately jumped on the Pro plan because of that.

Hey Seth, how's it going? I just discovered devICT through Meetup, very interested in checking out what y'all have been upto and wanted to say hi & introduce myself. 

I'm (kinda) local to ICT, living over in El Dorado, but spending a lot of time in the city. I'm a hobbyist / enthusiast trying to start in IT (aspiring towards Cloud/DevOps), though it's pretty rough out there right now. Also into game dev, music production, and TTRPGs. 

Very interested in meeting other locals and was curious what kinds of events / projects devICT has lined up?
